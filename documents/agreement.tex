\newpage

This \textbf{WHITEHAT SAFE HARBOR AGREEMENT (this \textit{Agreement})} sets forth the terms and conditions of the Program and is being entered into by, and is binding upon, each Protocol Community that adopts the Agreement and each Whitehat who conducts or attempts an Eligible Funds Rescue (collectively referred to as \textit{Parties}). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined on \underline{Exhibit A}.

\section*{Background Information}\label{sec:background}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item This Agreement has been prepared by the Security Alliance as part of an open source software implementation for decentralized technologies (i.e., on-chain protocols) within the blockchain/crypto ecosystem to incentivize and give comfort to Whitehats rescuing digital assets from active Exploits of a Protocol with respect to which this Agreement has been adopted by the relevant Protocol Community (each an \textit{Eligible Funds Rescue} that mitigates an \textit{Urgent Blackhat Exploit}, as defined below), and to provide a safe harbor for assets that are the subject of such an exploit.

    \item Each Protocol Community adopting this Agreement for its corresponding Protocol seeks to encourage Whitehats to responsibly test, seek to penetrate, and otherwise take advantage of the Protocol, and, pursuant to the Program, potentially receive a Reward for conducting Eligible Funds Rescues. Only Whitehats who agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and conduct an Eligible Funds Rescue pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be eligible to participate in the Program and potentially receive a Reward.

    \item Each Whitehat adopting this Agreement seeks to test and exploit a Protocol with respect to which this Agreement has been adopted by the Protocol Community, for the purpose of completing an Eligible Funds Rescue within the bounds set out in this Agreement, and accordingly wishes to enter into this Agreement to participate in the Program and become eligible to potentially receive a Reward pursuant to the parameters set forth herein. Each Whitehat should ensures that such Whitehat has sufficient experience to participate in the Program, including because such Whitehat is an experienced software developer, security professional, software engineer, or an Entity that employs or engages experienced blockchain software engineers or security professionals (e.g., auditors) with expertise in the exploitation of blockchain systems and the mitigation of attendant risks.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Eligible Protocols}\label{sec:eligible}

\subsection{Adoption of this Agreement by Protocol Communities}\label{subsec:adoption}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A Protocol is eligible for Eligible Funds Rescues under this Agreement if this Agreement has been duly adopted by the Protocol Community associated with such Protocol in accordance with the Adoption Procedures, and such adoption has not been subsequently renounced, revoked, annulled, voided, or rescinded by the Protocol Community. It is recommended that the DAO Adoption Procedures be accompanied by notices, information and disclosures based on those set forth on Exhibit B.

    \item This Agreement shall be:

          \begin{enumerate}
              \item binding upon and enforceable against any DAO with respect to any Protocol, by the DAO adopting this Agreement in accordance with the DAO Adoption Procedures;

              \item after adoption of this Agreement by the DAO Adoption Procedures, binding upon and enforceable against any Security Team with respect to any Protocol, by the Security Team adopting this Agreement in accordance with the Security Team Adoption Procedures; and

              \item after adoption of this Agreement by the DAO Adoption Procedures, binding upon an enforceable against any Users with respect to any Protocol, by the Users adopting this Agreement in accordance with the User Adoption Procedure.

          \end{enumerate}

    \item In the event that a Protocol does not have a DAO, the Security Team may utilize the DAO Adoption Procedures to indicate adoption of this Agreement with respect to the Protocol, and, in such event, references in this Agreement to the DAO shall instead be treated as references to theSecurity Team.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Uncertain Legal Classification of DAOs; Enforceability}\label{subsec:legal_classification}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Uncertain Legal Classification of DAOs}. It is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the legal classification of participating DAOs may be uncertain. There may exist uncertainties as to whether a DAO is a continuous single legal person, the criteria and term of membership in a DAO for persons participating in DAO-related activities, the rules by which the DAO or any member of or participant in the DAO may become a party to or bound by any agreement, and the applicability of any such agreement to prior or future members of or participants in the DAO.

    \item \textbf{Enforceability}. In light of the potential for the uncertain legal classification of DAOs to affect the enforceability of this Agreement against the DAO, any participants in or members of the DAO or the Protocol Community generally, the following non-exclusive order of preference concerning the Adoption Procedures and the subsequent enforceability of this Agreement is hereby acknowledged and agreed:

    \item If the DAO governing a Protocol is deemed to constitute a legal person and this Agreement is adopted through the DAO Adoption Procedures, then the DAO Adoption Procedures are intended to and shall be deemed to make this Agreement binding upon such legal person;

          \begin{enumerate}

              \item If the DAO governing a Protocol is deemed to be capable of binding the Protocol Community or Protocol Community Members to this Agreement through the DAO Adoption Procedures, then the DAO Adoption Procedures are intended to and shall be deemed to make this Agreement binding upon the Protocol Community and any and all Protocol Community Members, to the maximum extent permissible;

              \item If the individual past, present, and/or future participants in or members of the DAO governing such Protocol may be bound to an agreement through the DAO Adoption Procedures, then the DAO Adoption Procedures are intended to and shall be deemed to make this Agreement binding upon all such individual participants or members to the maximum extent permissible; or

              \item If the DAO is not deemed to be a legal person and it is not legally permitted to bind all individual past, present, and/or future participants in or members of the DAO hereto through the DAO Adoption Procedures, then, to the maximum extent permissible, this Agreement shall be deemed binding upon the individual Protocol Community Members, Users, or other persons who voted in favor of or otherwise expressly consented to, ratified, or affirmed this Agreement through the DAO Adoption Procedures, User Adoption Procedures, or otherwise.

          \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Covered Exploits \& Rewards}\label{sec:covered}

\subsection{Eligible Whitehats to be Compensated for Eligible Funds Rescues}\label{subsec:compensation}

If an Eligible Whitehat performs an Eligible Funds Rescue pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, then, as the sole compensation and reward for such performance, the Eligible Whitehat may be entitled to: (i) payment or retention of the applicable Bounty as set forth in Section \ref{sec:eligibility}; and (ii) the grant of a release of Claims as set forth in Section \ref{subsec:release_whitehat_liability_protocol_community} (the consideration described in the preceding clauses '(i)' and '(ii)', collectively, the "\textbf{Reward}").

\subsection{Limited Scope}\label{subsec:limited_scope}

This Agreement and the Reward granted hereunder are intended solely to provide compensation to Eligible Whitehats who complete Eligible Funds Rescues of Tokens from an Urgent Blackhat Exploit (as defined below).

All other pending, threatened, or possible Exploits; security vulnerabilities; or other facts and circumstances relating to a Protocol are not addressed by this Agreement and may be addressed, for example, through an ordinary security bounty program, or other rules, procedures, and agreements applicable to such Protocol.

\subsection{Certain Defined Terms}\label{subsec:defined_terms_2}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Exploit. An "\textbf{Exploit}" means an attack, hack, or exploit against all or any part of a Protocol.

    \item Eligible Whitehat. A Person (other than the owner/operator of a Generalized Arbitrage Bot) is an "\textbf{Eligible Whitehat}" with respect to a particular Exploit if and only if such person:

          \begin{enumerate}
              \item has read, understood, and agreed to be bound by this Agreement with respect to such Exploit;

              \item the representations and warranties in Section \ref{sec:warranties} are accurate and complete as to such person in connection with and at all times relevant to such Exploit;

              \item such person has not breached, contravened or violated any provision of this Agreement or any applicable or otherwise relevant law, legal order or any legally binding agreement in connection or at any time relevant to such Exploit;

              \item such person has fully complied with the requirements of Section \ref{sec:req_procedure_rescue} with respect to such Exploit; and,

              \item the Reward comprises such person's sole direct and indirect compensation, reward, and benefit in connection with the Exploit.

          \end{enumerate}

    \item Eligible Funds Rescues. An "\textbf{Eligible Funds Rescue}" is an Exploit and related actions or transactions that, taken together:

          \begin{enumerate}
              \item intercept, interrupt, block, interfere with, impede, disrupt, prevent, or mitigate the adverse effects of, an Urgent Blackhat Exploit;

              \item result in the complete transfer of all Returnable Assets (or the transfer of all Returnable Assets, \textit{minus} the applicable Bounty) to the Asset Recovery Address as promptly as reasonably practicable during or after such Exploit (except that, in the case of such an Exploit performed by a Generalized Arbitrage Bot, such transfer may be effected as promptly as reasonably practicable after the owner/operator of the Generalized Arbitrage Bot discovers that the Generalized Arbitrage Bot has executed such Exploit, but in no event more than 72 hours after such Exploit);

              \item have been performed in good faith solely for the purposes described in the preceding clauses '(i)' and '(ii)' and to earn the Reward (except that in the case of an Exploit automatically executed by a Generalized Arbitrage Bot, there need be no specific intent of the kind described in the preceding clause '(i)');

              \item are not conducted in a negligent, reckless, or fraudulent manner and do not constitute an intentional, knowing, reckless, or negligent breach of any applicable or otherwise relevant law, legal order, or any legally binding agreement; and

              \item otherwise comply with and satisfy all applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement.

          \end{enumerate}

    \item Generalized Arbitrage Bot. A "\textbf{Generalized Arbitrage Bot}" is software that autonomously monitors and analyzes substantially all transaction requests submitted to a blockchain network's mempool and seeks to automatically arbitrage or gain execution priority over third-party transactions for financial profit.

    \item Urgent Blackhat Exploits. "\textbf{Urgent Blackhat Exploit}" means an Exploit that, based on publicly available or otherwise verifiable information, would reasonably be considered to:

          \begin{enumerate}

              \item (A) have already been initiated against a Protocol and remain an active threat; or (B) be highly likely to be imminently initiated against a Protocol; and

              \item constitutes a reckless, malicious, illegal, unlawful, or otherwise harmful Exploit against a Protocol that is highly likely to imminently result in the loss, theft, misappropriation, freezing or other adverse impact on any Tokens directly or indirectly controlled by, deposited into, held by, or custodied with the Protocol, and for which the Whitehat is confident that a normal course bug bounty referral will not be sufficient to protect the funds.
          \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Required Procedures For Attempting Eligible Funds Rescues}\label{sec:req_procedure_rescue}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prospective Whitehats vs Retrospective Whitehats. Each person attempting or undertaking an Eligible Funds Rescue, seeking a Reward, or seeking the benefit of the consent to Exploits set forth in Section \ref{subsec:consent_exploit} is referred to herein as a "\textbf{Whitehat}". A Whitehat that is the owner/operator of a Generalized Arbitrage Bot who, upon discovering that an Exploit against a Protocol has been effected by such Generalized Arbitrage Bot, attempts or undertakes an Eligible Funds Rescue, is referred to herein as a "\textbf{Retrospective Whitehat}" and all other Whitehats are referred to herein as "\textbf{Prospective Whitehats}".

    \item Consent to Exploit by Prospective Whitehats.\label{subsec:consent_exploit} In the event that an Urgent Blackhat Exploit is highly likely to be imminently initiated or in process with respect to a Protocol and a Prospective Whitehat who satisfies the eligibility conditions set forth in clauses '(i)' through '(iii)' of Section \ref{subsec:defined_terms_2}(b) could reasonably be expected to complete an Eligible Funds Rescue with respect to such Urgent Blackhat Exploit, then, for so long as the Urgent Blackhat Exploit remains imminent or in process and such Prospective Whitehat otherwise complies with this Agreement, the Prospective Whitehat is hereby granted the consent of the Protocol Community to use best efforts to attempt the Eligible Funds Rescue with respect to the smart contracts included in the assets [deemed in scope by the Protocol Community], including by seeking to satisfy (or continuing to satisfy, as applicable) the eligibility conditions set forth in clauses '(ii)' through '(v)' of Section \ref{subsec:defined_terms_2}(b) so as to become an Eligible Whitehat and by performing a permitted type of Exploit (as contemplated by Section \ref{subsec:defined_terms_2}(c)) against the Protocol to the extent necessary to intercept, interrupt, block, interfere with, impede, disrupt, prevent, or mitigate the adverse effects of, such Urgent Blackhat Exploit.

    \item Notification of Attempted Eligible Funds Rescue.\label{subsec:notification_attempted_rescue}

          \begin{enumerate}
              \item The Whitehat shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Protocol Community that the Whitehat is attempting an Eligible Funds Rescue as soon as reasonably practicable in accordance with Section \ref{subsec:notices}.

              \item For Prospective Whitehats, it is strongly recommended, although not required, to deliver such notification prior to initiating an Exploit against the Protocol if doing so would not adversely affect the likelihood of achieving an Eligible Funds Rescue. For Retrospective Whitehats, it is strongly recommended that the Whitehat deliver such notification immediately after discovering that the Generalized Arbitrage Bot owned or operated by such Whitehat has executed an Exploit against the Protocol.

          \end{enumerate}
    \item Transfer of Assets to Asset Recovery Address.\label{subsec:transfer_assets}

          \begin{enumerate}
              \item The Whitehat shall at all times use best efforts to secure, and preserve the value of, all Exploited Assets.

              \item Upon removing, appropriating, diverting, or otherwise obtaining custody or control over any Exploited Assets, the Whitehat must use best efforts to transfer them to the Asset Recovery Address as promptly as reasonably practicable, as follows:

                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item If the Adopting Procedures for the relevant Protocol expressly allow for the Whitehat to deduct and retain the Bounty from the Exploited Assets, then the Whitehat shall transfer all Returnable Assets \textit{minus} the applicable Bounty, into the Asset Recovery Address as promptly as reasonably practicable.

                        \item If the Adopting Procedures for the relevant Protocol do not expressly allow for the Whitehat to deduct and retain the Bounty from the Exploited Assets, then the Whitehat shall transfer all Returnable Assets into the Asset Recovery Address as promptly as reasonably practicable.
                    \end{enumerate}

                    An Exploit with respect to which the Returnable Assets have not been so transferred into the Asset Recovery Address in accordance with the preceding clause '(A)' or clause '(B)', as applicable, shall not constitute an Eligible Funds Rescue and the Whitehat shall not be entitled to any Reward with respect thereto. In either case, if a Whitehat is unable to transfer the Returnable Assets into the Asset Recovery Address within six hours of obtaining custody or control over them, then the Whitehat must notify the Protocol Community, in accordance with Section \ref{subsec:notices}, of their continued intention to transfer the Returnable Assets into the Asset Recovery Address and the reasons for their inability to transfer those assets.

              \item "\textbf{Exploited Assets}" means, with respect to a given Urgent Blackhat Exploit, all Tokens that, directly or indirectly in connection with such Exploit, have been in whole or in part removed, appropriated, diverted, or otherwise obtained by or on behalf of a Whitehat from the Protocol.

              \item "\textbf{Asset Recovery Address}" means the blockchain network address to which Eligible Whitehat Hackers shall deposit the Returnable Assets—i.e., the address selected as the assetRecoveryAddress parameter during the DAO Adoption Procedures.

              \item "\textbf{Returnable Assets}" means, with respect to a given Urgent Blackhat Exploit, all of the Exploited Assets recovered by a Whitehat, \textit{minus} any Exploited Assets utilized by the Whitehat in good faith, arms-length transactions to pay transaction fees or costs necessary to perform the Exploit and return Exploited Assets to the Asset Recovery Address (including any value or Tokens lost as a result of "extractable value" or other arbitrage by validators or other third parties), provided that in each case the Whitehat used best efforts to minimize such fees and costs.

          \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Eligibility, Release and Bounty}\label{sec:eligibility}
\subsection{Eligibility Conditions}\label{subsec:eligibility_conditions}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Conditions Precedent. Each clause of the terms "Eligible Whitehat" and "Eligible Funds Rescue," and the fulfillment of each requirement set forth in the \code{identityRequirement} IdentityRequirement struct and diligenceRequirements string of the BountyTerms bountyTerms struct set by the DAO Adoption Procedures, shall be conditions precedent to any person's entitlement to receive a Reward. Such conditions precedent are in furtherance and not in limitation of the other terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event that a Whitehat receives or retains a Bounty (or any portion thereof) at a time when any of the aforementioned conditions precedent were not satisfied, the Bounty shall be deemed forfeit and the Whitehat shall, upon demand by the Protocol Community or any Protocol Community Member, immediately transfer the full amount of any Retained Bounty directly to the Asset Recovery Address.

    \item Relationship of Protocol Community to Whitehat. Under no circumstances do the Protocol Community or any Protocol Community Member seek through this Agreement to facilitate, encourage, or condone any conduct by Whitehat that violates any Legal Requirement under any applicable jurisdiction or any fraudulent, misleading, manipulative, reckless, or negligent conduct by Whitehat towards any Party or non-party to this Agreement. The Protocol Community disclaims any liability or direct or consequential damages caused by Whitehat by participating in the Program, and make no representations or warranties to Whitehat that participation in the Program under the terms of this Agreement will protect Whitehat from liability except as otherwise specified in Section \ref{subsec:release_whitehat_liability_protocol_community} below.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Bounty}\label{subsec:bounty}

\begin{enumerate}


    \item Bounty. "\textbf{Bounty}" means, with respect to a particular Urgent Blackhat Exploit and the resulting Eligible Funds Rescue(s) completed by an Eligible Whitehat, Tokens equal in US Dollar value to \textit{lesser of}: (i) the bountyPercentage (specified during the DAO Adoption Procedures) of the US Dollar value, based on the timestamp of the block that was proposed in the Protocol immediately preceding the Eligible Funds Rescue, of Returnable Assets recovered by each Eligible Whitehat and transferred to the Asset Recovery Address from such Eligible Whitehat's originating blockchain address(es); or (ii) the bountyCapUSD (specified during the DAO Adoption Procedures); \textit{provided, however}, that notwithstanding the foregoing definition of "Bounty" or any other provision of this Agreement the total aggregate amount of all Bounties payable to all Eligible Whitehats in connection with a particular Exploit or series of related Exploits shall not exceed the aggregateBountyCapUSD (as specified during the DAO Adoption Procedures) (the "\textbf{Aggregate Bounty Cap}"). If the total U.S. dollar value of Bounties payable to all Eligible Whitehats in connection with a particular Exploit or series of related Exploits would otherwise exceed the aggregateBountyCapUSD, then such Bounties shall be automatically deemed reduced on a pro rata basis such that the total aggregate U.S. dollar value of all such Bounties equals the aggregateBountyCapUSD.

    \item Payment of Bounty. Following the completion of an Eligible Funds Rescue and the determination that the Whitehat is eligible for a Reward pursuant to the terms of this Agreement:

          \begin{enumerate}

              \item In the event that the Whitehat has returned all of the Returnable Assets, the Protocol Community will pay the Bounty to the Whitehat, subject to the terms of this Agreement. Payment of the Bounty is to be made to the Whitehat's address as nominated at the time of delivery of the Returnable Assets to the Asset Recovery Address. In the event that the Protocol Community fails to transfer the Bounty to the Whitehat within a reasonable time (and in no event more than 15 calendar days after the date that the first or only Returnable Assets are sent to the Asset Recovery Address), or in the event that the Whitehat and Protocol Community are unable to agree upon the amount of the Bounty, the Reward Dispute Procedures, as set forth in Section \ref{subsec:reward_dispute}, shall apply. The Protocol Community may, in its reasonable discretion, require that a Whitehat provide backup withholding documentation (such as Form W-9 or W-8 (series) for Protocol Communities subject to income taxation in the United States), and, if not provided in a reasonable amount of time, deduct the required amounts of backup withholding from any such Bounty payment to a Whitehat.

              \item In the event that (A) the retainable boolean was set to TRUE in the DAO Adoption Procedures; and (B) the Whitehat has retained the Bounty, and sent all Returnable Assets to the Asset Recovery Address less the amount retained by the Whitehat as the Bounty (a "\textbf{Retained Bounty}"), the Whitehat shall verify in writing to the Protocol Community the address at which the Retained Bounty is located and not move the Retained Bounty from this address. The Protocol Community shall, within a reasonable time and in no event more than 15 calendar days, send written verification to the Whitehat as to whether the Protocol Community disputes the amount of the Retained Bounty. In the event no notice is sent to the Whitehat within the timeframe specified in the preceding sentence, the Retained Bounty amount shall be presumed acceptable to the Protocol Community. In the event that the Protocol Community disputes the amount of the Retained Bounty, the Reward Dispute Procedures, as set forth in Section \ref{subsec:reward_dispute}, shall apply. If there is an Aggregate Bounty Cap (as determined during the DAO Adoption Procedures and referred to in Section \ref{subsec:bounty}(a) above), then there must be no Retained Bounty (as determined during the DAO Adoption Procedures). This ensures the Protocol Community can accurately enforce the Aggregate Bounty Cap and allocate payouts on a pro rata basis.

          \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Reward Dispute Procedures}\label{subsec:reward_dispute}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Reward Dispute Procedures. In the event that a dispute between the Protocol Community exists as to: (x) the amount of a Bounty, (y) whether the Whitehat is entitled to a Reward; or (z) whether the Bounty is subject to offset pursuant to Section \ref{subsec:indemnity}(a) below (each, a "\textbf{Reward Dispute}"), the Parties shall identify the amount of the Bounty and all other aspects of the Reward which are disputed (the "\textbf{Disputed Amount}") and the following procedures shall apply.

          \begin{enumerate}
              \item If the Reward Dispute relates to the value of the tokens comprising the Bounty only (i.e., if the Protocol Community and Whitehat agree that the Whitehat is entitled to a Reward, but cannot agree on the value of the Bounty), the Party in possession of the Disputed Amount shall transfer the Disputed Amount into an escrow account that requires the signature of the Whitehat and Protocol Community to be released. Each Party shall, within 30 calendar days, appoint an appraiser or other valuation expert to render an opinion as to the proper amount of the Bounty (an "\textbf{Appraisal}"). In the event that the higher of the Appraisals is no greater than 130\% of the lower Appraisal, the Bounty shall be the average of the two Appraisals. In the event that the higher of the Appraisals is greater than 130\% of the lower Appraisal, the appraisers shall appoint a neutral third-party appraiser, whose Appraisal shall control the amount and allocation of the Bounty. Upon the conclusion of this appraisal process, the Parties shall release the escrowed Bounty amount(s) to whichever Party is entitled to all or a portion of the Disputed Amount.

              \item If the Reward Dispute relates to the entitlement of the Whitehat to a Reward, a Claim by an Indemnitee gives rise to a Disputed Amount, or if the dispute relates to the amount of Returnable Assets owed to the Protocol Community, the Arbitration provisions of Section \ref{subsec:arbitrable_disputes} shall apply.

          \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

However, in all events, the provisions contained in this Agreement shall govern over any conflicting rules which may now or hereafter be contained in the SIAC Rules. Any judgment upon the award rendered through arbitration shall be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof and over the Person against whom the award rendered is to be enforced.

A final decision rendered through arbitration may be submitted for entry to a court of competent jurisdiction.

              \item Any such arbitration will be conducted in English before a panel of three arbitrators who will be compensated for their services at a rate to be determined by the parties or by SIAC, but based upon reasonable hourly or daily consulting rates for each arbitrator in the event the parties are not able to agree upon his or her rate of compensation.

              \item The members of the panel of arbitrators shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties. In the event the parties are unable to agree within 20 days following submission of the dispute to SIAC by one of the parties, SIAC will have the authority to select panel members from a list of arbitrators who satisfy the criteria set forth in clause '(vi)' below.

              \item Each arbitrator must not have any past or present family, business or other relationship with the parties or any relevant Indemnitee, unless, following full disclosure of all such relationships, the parties and any relevant Indemnitee agree in writing to waive such requirement with respect to each arbitrator in connection with such dispute. In addition, unless otherwise agreed by the parties and any relevant Indemnitee in writing, an arbitrator in any dispute related to an Arbitrable Dispute shall have at least 15 years' experience in the negotiation of complex corporate transactions; \textit{provided, however}, that if SIAC is not able to provide an arbitrator for such arbitration with the requisite experience set forth in this clause '(vi)', such arbitrator shall be a retired Article III Federal District Court judge of the United States with prior experience as an arbitrator.

              \item The parties will each pay 50\% of the initial compensation to be paid to the arbitrators in any such arbitration and 50\% of the costs of transcripts and other normal and regular expenses of the arbitration proceedings; \textit{provided, however}, that: (A) the prevailing party in any arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and costs; and (B) all costs of arbitration, other than those provided for above, will be paid by the losing party, and the arbitrator will be authorized to determine the identity of the prevailing party and the losing party. The losing party shall be determined solely by the arbitrator.

              \item The arbitrators chosen in accordance with these provisions will not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration provisions or any other provisions contained in this Agreement.

              \item Any ruling or decision of the arbitrators may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

          \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise of Indemnification Remedies Other Than by Protocol Community}\label{subsec:exercise_indemnification}

No Indemnitee (other than Protocol Community) shall be permitted to assert any claim to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed or to exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless Protocol Community shall have consented to the assertion of such claim or the exercise of such other remedy (it being understood and agreed that no such consent by Protocol Community shall otherwise modify or operate as a waiver of the rights and obligations of any party to this Agreement).
